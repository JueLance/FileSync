FileSync
========

I have bought a NAS(QNAP TS-420), when experienced the QSync app, I found it works very slow. However, I found we can use the FileStation Web API to make another app to help us upload file to NAS. In the future, we can add more functions into it and instead of QSync. Currently, it just a prototype, if you are interesting in it, free feel join it.
